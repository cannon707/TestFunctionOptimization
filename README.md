# TestFunctionOptimization

There are many test functions for optimization that are used in biologically inspired computation. This project tested 17 different functions using particle swarm optimization and an evolutionary algorithm. The final project report can be found [here](https://github.com/hkitts/TestFunctionOptimization/blob/main/hkitts2FinalReport.pdf).

# Solution Graphs
These graphs include the number of times a solution was found using either method.
